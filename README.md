# Taquin
The three files are the same game of "jeu de taquin", the difference between them is the method of AI search.
The first one is the BFS(Breadth-first search).
The second is DFS(Depth-first search) with no-limits.
And the last is the same as the one mentionned before but with limits.
i implemented the "tkinter" module for the GUI.
